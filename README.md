# AIVA
Created an AI Voice Assistant (AIVA) that should act as a therapist/friend/diary to help the user with their thoughts.

1. Needs to run diagnostics on data to determine which characteristics in a text sentence or voice reveal the mood of the user.
2. Need to then determine how the voice assistant would respond to the user.
3. Determine if there are other inputs you would like the user to have (diary entry, advice, etc).
